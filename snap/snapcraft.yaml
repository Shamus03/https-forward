summary: A forwarding HTTPS server using Let's Encrypt
license: Apache-2.0
description: "Provides a forwarding HTTPS server which transparently fetches and caches certificates via Let's Encrypt. This must run on 443 and 80 (just forwards to https://) and can't coexist with any other web server on your machine.

*Why?* This is so you can host random and long-lived services publicly on the internetâ€”perfect services which don't care about certificates or HTTPS at all. A good way to use this is to set up a wildcard record like `*.example.com` to point to your server (but don't worry, this service won't respond unless you explicitly define a host in your configuration file).

Configure this via `/var/snap/https-forward/common/config`, which is empty after install. It should be authored like this:

   # hostname            forward-to          optional-basic-auth
   host.example.com      localhost:8080
   blah.example.com      192.168.86.24:7999  user:pass
   user-only.example.com localhost:9002      user       # accepts any password
   
   # ... specify host with '.' to suffix all following
   .example.com
   test                  localhost:9000
   under-example         any-hostname-here.com:9000

Restart or SIGHUP the `https-forward` binary to reread the config file. You can read logs to ensure that the file has been parsed properly:

   sudo journalctl -u snap.https-forward.https-forward
